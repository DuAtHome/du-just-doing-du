Hello there!

Welcome to my blog. Here, I will talk about technology, history, science, and occasionally current events.

## About Me

My name is Du Cheng, I am a software developer, privacy advocate, and ethical hacker. I develop FOSS (Free Open Source Software) that improves the world, and protects people from unethical companies like [Apple](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-knowingly-used-child-labor-supplier-3-years-cut-costs-2020-12), [Google](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753), [Microsoft](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.en.html), and [Facebook](https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/17/technology/facebook-lawsuit-facial-recognition/index.html).

In fact, this website is open source. You can grab the source and customize it to your liking. Take a look [right here](https://github.com/DuAtHome/du-just-doing-du).
