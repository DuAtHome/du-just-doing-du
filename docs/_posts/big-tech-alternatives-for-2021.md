Big Tech is going crazy with censorship lately. They are censoring everyone from Donald Trump to Sci Hub. Amazon recently cut ties with Parler, the social media website with basically no rules.

They do have their reasons, and after taking a look at their public statements, they seem fairly reasonable given the circumstances.

## About the Alts

Each one of these was hand-picked by me for maximum security, and compared to common software from big tech companies.

* **Google ->** [**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com/)

  Known for it's censoring of websites on the largest search engine, Google is manipulating your search results. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) doesn't track you, steal your data, or do anything shady.
* **Facebook ->** [**MeWe**](https://mewe.com/)

  What _isn't_ wrong with them? Along with pushing political agendas on the Facebook and Instagram software, they collect data from WhatsApp users without their knowledge, gather facial recognition data from non-consenting people, and track you as much as they can. I suggest [MeWe](https://mewe.com/) as it is designed with privacy as the core value.
* **Twitter ->** [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org/)

  Twitter recently censored Donald Trump, the previous President of the United States. They also regularly censor anti-covid opinions, oh and they are allowing pedophiles onto their platform and not regulating the content due to "sexual preference". Sick fucks. Anyways, use [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). It's a federated social platform that doesn't spy on you, and has millions of users.
* **YouTube ->** [**Odysee**](https://odysee.com/)

  Remember, YouTube is a Google product. They will happily censor anyone who doesn't agree, such as the entire crypto community. They aren't as bad as a company like Twitter or Facebook, but they are still unethical so they belong on the list.
